D-Bus 1.1.4 - 1.2.0RC2 (17 January 2007)
==
- Fixes inotify support

D-Bus 1.1.3 - 1.2.0RC1 (15 January 2007)
==

- This release is intended to be Release Candidate 1 of major release
  D-Bus 1.2.0.  If nothing is found to be wrong with this release it
  will become 1.2.0 within a week.  If we need to make major changes
  we will release an RC2 and start the process over again.

- This is a development release, so API's may still change if problems
  are found (though this is extreamly unlikely).

- DTD for the introspection format is fixed and uploaded to the servers

- Sources now reside in a git repository at 
  http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus.git;a=summary

- Argument path matching of the type arg0path='/aa/bb/' is now supported
  (see the specification for more information)

- New error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ObjectPathInUse added

- Autolaunched busses now save their parameters in X11 if possible making them
  behave closer to busses launched through the normal mechanisms 

- inotify is now the default backend for watching configuration file changes

- More support for the AIX platform has been added

- Numerous bug fixes and performance enhancements

D-Bus 1.1.2 (27 July 2007)
==

- This release is intended to be a feature complete beta for stable
  release 1.2.0, please test it. 1.2.0 will follow pretty soon if no
  major problems are found.  We'll do more betas if significant
  changes are made.

- This is a development release, so API's may still change if problems
  are found (though we will try hard not to).

- The system bus now supports starting services on demand. This uses a
  setuid helper program because system bus daemon runs as a nobody
  user, while services it launches may need to run as a different
  user.

  ***Extra eyes auditing the setuid helper are encouraged and would be
  timely right now, before 1.2.0***

  A design doc is available in doc/system-activation.txt

- The TCP address format has been enhanced, such that TCP may be
  actually usable.  The dbus-daemon man page describes the new
  elements in the address format.  1.1.1 had added an all_interfaces
  flag to the format, which has been removed in favor of a cleaner
  approach.

- Some thread-related bugs have been fixed, these are important fixes
  if you are using multiple threads with libdbus, and not important
  otherwise.


D-Bus 1.1.1 (18 June 2007)
==
- This is a development release, unless you need specific 
  functionality please use the stable releases as API's may change
  (though we will try hard not to)
- The bus daemon now generates a globally-unique ID for itself, which is available 
  using the convenience function dbus_bus_get_id(). Use this as a unique ID 
  for a user's session, for example.
- dbus_server_get_id(), dbus_connection_get_server_id() now available to access
  the unique ID of a particular address
- dbus_watch_get_fd() deprecated since it had unclear cross-platform semantics.
  dbus_watch_get_unix_fd() and dbus_watch_get_socket() replace it.
- support ANONYMOUS mechanism for authentication, which allows a client to 
  authenticate as nobody in particular
- add API dbus_connection_set_allow_anonymous() which will allow the message
  stream to begin if the client auths as anonymous (otherwise, the client 
  will be dropped unless they auth as a user).
- the ANONYMOUS support means you can now use D-Bus (without a bus daemon) as 
  a protocol for a network service provided to anonymous Internet or LAN  
  clients
- many internal changes to better support the Windows port, though the 
  port is still not complete in this release
- some improved documentation and return_if_fail checks
- some small bug fixes

D-Bus 1.1.0 (25 May 2007)
==
- first release in the development series, unless you need specific 
  functionality please use the stable releases as API's may change
  (though we will try hard not to)
- better eavesdropping support now picks up reply messages for debugging
- .pc file now lists the directory the daemon is installed into (daemondir)
- GetAll call added to the properties interface
- support for message serialization added for use with external transports like
  TUBES!!!
- many bugs fixed
