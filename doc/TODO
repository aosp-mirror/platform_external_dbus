 - Message matching rules (so broadcasts can be filtered) need sorting
   out.

 - How we will handle DCOP needs sorting out. Among other things, we
   need to check that service and service-ownership semantics map to DCOP 
   reasonably well.

 - Activation needs some careful additional thinking-through.

 - Property list feature on message bus (list of properties associated 
   with a connection). May also include message matching rules 
   that involve the properties of the source or destination
   connection.

 - Automatic service activation, should probably be done through a message flag.

 - Disconnecting the remote end on invalid UTF-8 is probably not a good 
   idea. The definitiion of "valid" is slightly fuzzy. I think it might 
   be better to just silently "fix" the UTF-8, or perhaps return an error.

   Owen says we should only validate the UTF-8 on dbus_message_get_string()
   (changing get_string to have an error return, and allowing a type error 
   as a possible return)

 - The convenience functions in dbus-bus.h should perhaps have
   the signatures that they would have if they were autogenerated
   stubs. e.g. the acquire service function. We should also evaluate 
   which of these functions to include, in light of the fact that 
   GLib/Qt native stubs will probably also exist.

 - The message handler interface needs rethinking, perhaps handlers should be able 
   to return an error that automatically gets turned into a message; most likely 
   some basic spec'ing out of the GLib/Qt level stubs/skels stuff will be 
   needed to understand the right approach.

 - there are various bits of code to manage ref/unref of data slots, that should 
   be merged into a generic facility

 - assorted _-prefixed symbols in libdbus aren't actually used by
   libdbus, only by the message bus. These bloat up the library
   size. Not sure how to fix, really.

 - if you send a message to a service then block for reply, and the service exits/crashes
   after the message bus has processed your message but before the service has replied, 
   it would be nice if the message bus sent you an error reply.

 - write a DTD for the dbus-daemon-1 configuration file

 - build and install the Doxygen manual in Makefile when --enable-docs

 - if you send the same message to multiple connections, the serial number 
   will only be right for one of them. Probably need to just write() the serial 
   number, rather than putting it in the DBusMessage, or something.

 - perhaps the bus driver should have properties that reflect attributes
   of the session, such as hostname, architecture, operating system, 
   etc. Could be useful for code that wants to special-case behavior 
   for a particular host or class of hosts, for example.

 - currently the security policy stuff for messages to/from 
   the bus driver is kind of strange; basically it's hardcoded that 
   you can always talk to the driver, but the default config file 
   has rules for it anyway, or something. it's conceptually 
   screwy at the moment.

 - <limit> elements are not merged in from included configuration 
   files; they have to be in the toplevel file. when loading 
   a child file, we could just init its DBusLimits from the parent, 
   then after parsing copy its DBusLimits back to the parent
